## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

1. **Download** `HeatMap.bas` from this repository
2. **Open** your Excel file
3. **Press** `Alt + F11` (opens VBA Editor)
4. **Find** the HeatMap module in the left panel
5. **Select All** (`Ctrl + A`) and **Delete** the old code
6. **Open** HeatMap.bas in a text editor, **Copy All** (`Ctrl + A`, `Ctrl + C`)
7. **Paste** into VBA Editor (`Ctrl + V`)

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### The Bugs
1. **DR Column Filter**: Two functions were incorrectly filtering out "DR" columns:
   - `CollectHeaders` (line 269-271)
   - `CollectHeaderCols` (line 285-287)
   - They were checking: `And UCase$(ws.Cells(anc.row, c).Value) <> "DR"`
   - This excluded all DR columns (DR1, DR2, DR3, etc.) which contain the vehicle data!

2. **Case-Sensitive Mode Matching**: The `BuildModeIndex` function used a case-sensitive dictionary
   - "transition to constant speed" ≠ "Transition to Constant Speed"
   - Operation modes with different capitalization wouldn't match and data wouldn't transfer

### The Fix
1. **Removed** the incorrect DR filter from both functions
   - Now they check: `If Trim$(ws.Cells(anc.row, c).Value) <> ""`
   - This includes ALL non-empty columns, including DR columns ✅

2. **Made mode matching case-insensitive**
   - Added: `d.CompareMode = vbTextCompare` to `BuildModeIndex`
   - Operation modes now match regardless of capitalization ✅

### Bonus
Added a warning message when source data exceeds destination capacity, so users know when data is being truncated.

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before (BROKEN ❌)
```
Source: 4 vehicles (DR1, DR2, DR3, DR4) with data
↓
CollectHeaders: Returns [] (empty, DR columns skipped)
CollectHeaderCols: Returns [] (empty, DR columns skipped)
Mode matching: Case-sensitive (mismatches fail)
↓
n = Min(4, 0) = 0
↓
Transfer: 0 vehicles copied
Result: NO DATA ❌
```

### After (FIXED ✅)
```
Source: 4 vehicles (DR1, DR2, DR3, DR4) with data
↓
CollectHeaders: Returns [DR1, DR2, DR3, DR4] ✅
CollectHeaderCols: Returns [2, 3, 4, 5] ✅
Mode matching: Case-insensitive (all matches work) ✅
↓
n = Min(4, 4) = 4
↓
Transfer: ALL 4 vehicles copied
Result: ALL DATA TRANSFERRED ✅
```

## 🧪 How to Verify It Works

After importing HeatMap.bas:

1. ✅ Ensure your "Data Transfer Sheet" has multiple vehicles with data
2. ✅ Click the heatmap refresh button
3. ✅ Check the "HeatMap Sheet"
4. ✅ Verify ALL vehicle columns now have data
5. ✅ If you have more source vehicles than destination capacity, you should see a warning message
